<p>
	<br /> <br /> I am an avid programmer with 4 years of experience coding in python, 2 years of solo
	game development with Godot, 1 year of Rust, and 5 months of cybersecurity training. My biggest
	python project is a discord bot I wrote in freshman year of college. It was made to perform market
	analysis of the cryptocurrency game: Axie Infinity, and integrate with google sheets to create
	comprehensive reports. This, along with this website, was hosted in the cloud, completely from
	scratch. Configuring of nginx, and attainment of ssl certificates, were all done manually in
	Amazon Lightsail. Besides Amazon, I have worked with Vultr, and Microsoft Azure as well. <br />
	<br />
	I am currently a sophomore in the University of Utah, working towards my Computer Science with an emphasis
	in Games degree. I am a member of the NSLS, and am the programming team lead for the University of
	Utah’s Student Robotics Team, which regularly participates in NASA’s lunabotics competition. As such,
	I have experience working with the Robot Operating System, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence.
	<br /> <br />
	 Alongside my technical aptitude, I have some skill in 3D modelling using Blender, and using the Adobe
	suite for editing videos and photos. Some of my photos are available on Pexels as stock photos, and
	most of my 3D projects are shown in my instagram. <br /> <br />  Since I am a budding game developer,
	I am always open to collaborations with people for small projects. The best way to do so is to send
	me an email. If you are also a student at the University of Utah, your best place to find me would
	be the rock climbing gym at the Student Life Center!
